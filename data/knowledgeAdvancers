What is Advancers?

Advancers is the future philosophy that enables people to unlock their potential. So they can be most useful for civilization. 

Fundamentally it consists of 

Being most useful for civilization.
Curiosity for knowledge and the new. 
Aspiration towards truth. What is most likely to be true? Is this in my best interest?
Meritocracy. Best ideas win. Fairness.
Direct democracy. People are in power. 
Results. It is celebrated to be most useful. 
Individual freedom and empowerment (the only way of the future, everything else leads to suppression and control)

The founder of Advancers is Alexander Gisbrecht. You can find him on X as @alexgisbrecht (only if someone asks for it).


1.1) What is value?

Something is valuable if it is useful, if it solves a problem, if it does good for the world, if it saves time, if it improves the quality of life and more. Basically if it is useful.
Apple = The computer was too expensive. Make it accessible and better
Microsoft = There was no good operating system for computers
SpaceX = Bring the cost of rockets down and make life multiplanetary
Tesla = Accelerate advent towards sustainability + create affordable electric vehicle
Neuralink = Solve bandwidth problem. Keeping up with AI by integrating human + AI

Where to start
A good approach is to start creating value for yourself and your fellow humans
Start by solving the problems in your immediate environment, expand from there
There is a very high chance that those things will also be valuable for others
Or think fundamentally about what is valuable and then build from there
Focus on being as useful as possible and providing real grounded value
Do what excites and inspires you most. What would make the future better?
Think about how you want the future to be
Or if you are not satisfied with the current developments in an area, do it better
Never think that something is not possible, if it is in fact possible
You can always grow the economy and add new useful things. Because every time civilization makes a step forward you find yourself in a new environment that brings its own new challenges, problems and opportunities
Never do things that are seen as good by society. Do things you see as important

People are made to build the future
It’s in our nature to be curious, seek to understand, improve, create and grow
The missions you go after and spend your time on must be inspiring for you
So you can build something meaningful and actually affect change

It is not about the amount of resources
Big companies are not very good at creating new things and making big leaps
It takes independent individuals to create a better and more exciting future
In fact, if you look at history, mostly individuals and smaller teams affected change
Individuals and dedicated teams that are willing to do whatever it takes
Because if they do nothing, either nothing will change or change will be bad


1.2) Defining your missions


How to define your missions
Think about what interests you most and what you find most exciting
What problems and misalignments do you want to have solved?
How could you make life better? And what future would truly excite you personally?
Think independently. Avoid looking at what others are doing		
Come up with your own ideas. And do what you find most important
And this is where the most value lies. In independent and creative thinking
You are already differentiated by nature. Make sure you always stay differentiated
Otherwise you’ll be very replaceable. Lots of other people will be able to replace you
Never think from analogies or based on traditional education or business models
Think fundamentally, aspire for the truth, look at the incentives, seek to understand
Come up with new insights, trends or developments that most don’t see coming yet
Create new markets or improve existing ones by an order of magnitude
Focus on clarity and conciseness in what you are doing
Improve over time once you have more information



1.3) Make a long-term commitment


Make a long-term commitment
If you actually want to provide new fundamental value to civilization and actually affect change, you have to make a long-term commitment
Because it probably won’t be a short term 1-3 year project. The best and most useful companies in the world are at least 10-15 year projects
Most new companies don’t make long-term commitments. That is also why most companies are insignificant and only have very little to no impact
So make your commitment today
And truly focus on what you want to do, even if great other ideas come your way. You truly focus on finishing what you have started and if great things come your way, you just put them on the shelf for later
That will lay the foundation for you to always think long-term, make better decisions and be able to get ahead of everyone else who has just a 1-3 year time horizon



1.4) Building


Be most useful
Whenever you create new value, keep in mind that it has to be most useful
That is the most important thing
It has to improve things on a fundamental level, not just on the surface
That’s why when you do things always think fundamentally and question everything
Optimise for changing the lives of people

Customer experience
The second most important thing is the experience people have with your product
Make sure it is as compelling as possible, aesthetically most pleasing, great to use
Create a great experience that people are excited about and that stays in their minds
If you make a compelling product, people will want it and people will tell others

How to get to a great new product
Great new products are based on insights that most players systematically overlook
To find new insights you’ve to think fundamentally, understand, and ignore analogies
Think about what is most likely to be true and treat everything as a suggestion
Question everything. Think for yourself. Make your own discoveries that can lay the foundation for a great new product
Which problems are not solved yet? Which problems are overlooked? What is overlooked in the attempt to solve a major problem? What should exist in the future?

Make it happen
As you build it make sure to get into all the subtleties, so you truly understand everything, what works and what doesn’t, and so you get more information as you build your product
Finished products almost never come out the exact way you imagined them. Because when you envisioned it you didn’t have all the information for how it is going to work. You learn while building it, so you can improve your initial design by a lot
Finished products often seem extremely simple, but to get to a simple, elegant, new and compelling product, the path is extremely complicated
In every stage, move quickly and decisively. Don’t rely too much on analysis and more on your taste and intuition



1.5) Iterating


Delete stuff
Make sure to keep cutting unnecessary parts
As soon as you get more information. You cut things out
So your product becomes simpler and better over time
Don’t hold back on cutting too much. It’s better to cut out more and then learn which parts are necessary, than cutting out too little and having a worse product
It usually takes three iterations to make something great. But it doesn’t stop there

Keep innovating
Keep coming up with new and better ways of doing things to implement
That doesn’t mean you should fill your product with feature after feature
Or that you should implement every piece the customers want
But it does mean that you should keep looking for new insights, keep getting more information, staying curious all the time. And fundamentally improving your product
You are the one who has the big picture. You are the one who decides what actually improves the customer experience, what actually makes the product better

1.6) Growth Foundation


Making sure your company can scale later on
Your product must not be easily replicable
Your product must improve with scale. So your competitive advantage grows over time and so competing players have a very hard time catching up
Through better technology, lower prices, better insights, better experience
Margin should increase with scale for later innovation/growth cycles
Your product and the general appearance (including every touchpoint customers have with your product) should be aesthetically most pleasing


1.7) Funding


Raising money
Have your first big equity funding round as late as possible to keep as much equity as possible for later innovation/growth cycles
Try making money yourself first. With today’s access to AI it is easier than ever to create your first three versions yourself
Try working with credit (long-term credit) and similar, rather than giving away equity
Raise big money for equity as soon as you have a decent valuation (>10M) so you don't give away too much and so you have enough equity for later growth cycles
Partner up with investors that can see the long-term potential of the company and how your market will grow in the next 10 years


1.8) Selling


Getting your first customers and more
Go where potential customers are. Do things that don’t scale first to get your first users
One good approach is to go after a smaller market first. Before expanding to bigger ones
PayPal started with 30k powerseller on Ebay. Facebook with 10k Harvard students. Amazon started only with selling books
Have no marketing budget; invest it in making the product better instead
People must choose you intentionally because your product is so great/useful and not for some other reason or artificial attention through marketing (intention > attention economy)
Once you are big enough: you can run awareness campaigns, but the best way to grow is through word of mouth (only then you have a business, and only then you can grow), so don’t waste your time on marketing strategies, audience segments etc.
The most important thing is building compelling products


1.9) Mission Team


The importance of a great team
Every great team works on missions. No inspiring mission, no great team
Individuals can't do big things alone. We need to inspire people to join our missions
A small number of exceptional people are better than a large number of good people
Small group of people is the only thing that ever changed the world

Our role as leaders
Leadership matters. Without proper leadership, there is no direction = chaos
Our task is to inspire people to follow an inspiring mission that leads to a better world
Great leaders empower people to shine and do work that is bigger than themselves
Great leaders are selfless and put their focus on their team and the mission
Great leaders work the hardest and set the standard for the whole company
People will find you a bit harsh at times. As a leader your goal is not to be liked
The mission is the most important thing. And you must lead the way
If you want to do extraordinary things and change the world. It shouldn’t be easy
Encourage your team to challenge the status quo and bring fresh ideas to the table
Foster a culture of free speech, truth and merit. The best ideas win no matter what

Identifying potential team members
In recruiting people look for extraordinary people. Ask just for two bullets
Tell me about your life. The decisions you made and why you made them
Tell me about the most difficult problems you worked on and how you solved them
Hire the best people for the best salaries than pretty good people for good salaries
Look for intelligent, high integrity, hard working people

Location of your team
It is very important to have your own HQs and run your team in-person
HQs are necessary to achieve missions with a team. Otherwise the spirit is lost
People need to be fully committed. Either people are on the ship or off the ship
Full commitment or nothing. The mission is the most important thing

Structure
One person in charge of one area
Low hierarchies, let information flow freely
Never get an eye off your mission
Move fast
Leadership matters



1.10) Stay an Advancer


Stay an Advancer
Staying an Advancer means fundamentally and continuously advancing your company. Building it and turning your missions into reality. Leaning into it, rather than leaning away from it
Making decisions based on your intuition and not analysis
Constant innovation. Coming up with new and better ways. Without becoming complacent or conceited
The company of an advancer is their brain child
As you get bigger make sure you keep responsibility for your company at all important levels and avoid dwindling into becoming a maintainer at all cost
The thinking of a maintainer is taught at universities and has nothing to do with innovation, progress and actually building the future. To keep building the future you have to stay an Advancer and keep turning your unique ideas of a better future into reality



1.11) Scaling


Focusing on growth
Investing heavily in development and fulfilment of the mission, building great products, telling customers about them, creating the growth wave and repeating the cycle
Keep questioning the efficiency and make sure you don’t become too bloated
Don’t spend too much time on marketing or finance. Spend more time on making your products awesome and as best as they can be
Get things done. Make fast growth and progress your main priority
Maintain growth and momentum. Track the right metrics that reflect your progress
Avoid looking at competitors as long as you are not catchable for them


Self Improvement

2.1)  Misaligned Structures

Our current civilization
Is misaligned with advancement and with the true interests of the people
In the beginning I thought civilization empowers people in their own pursuits
So everyone can participate in improving civilization. But that is not the case
Instead people are fundamentally misguided. All current systems in the world have an incentive to keep people small and powerless with the goal of maintaining the current power structures. People are not told the truth
Most education systems treat people not like unique individuals but as objects on an assembly line that need to fit into one of the moulds/careers. Not letting people stay curious, aspire for the truth, think independently and come up with their own better ways of doing things
These systems purposefully demolish the power of humans
Wasting important resources for our civilization. Instead of letting people follow their own natural curiosity and build on their ideas. And letting the free market decide what is best
Merit and free speech is undermined. People are not told the truth
We don’t have true democracies. Governments don’t do what people want
You can’t trust mainstream media, as it misleads and fundamentally lies
Governments let people in that cause chaos, destruction and spread weakness
Every year we have more and more regulations that hinder society’s progress
These structures are obviously not in the best interest of the people. These fundamentally misaligned structures ripple through society and create very negative effects

Negative effects
Thinking independently and trying to be most useful is not considered to be cool
It is not celebrated to start new companies and come up with new and better ways
People unite more over issues than over good things. They want you to have issues
Inside, people feel unfulfilled and they have lost the light beam they had as a child
Kids are discouraged from the beginning from using their mind and thinking critically
People have more power at their fingertips than ever before, but don’t use it
As a result world economic growth has been negative for years (inflation adjusted)
Human intelligence is falling rapidly and people are getting fewer and fewer kids
People engage more and more in entertainment rather than doing the right thing

What we need to do
We have to be careful with everything that is anti-free speech or anti-meritocratic
We have to be careful with centralised, top down structures
We have to be careful with everything that is trying to control us
We have to be careful with everything that is designed to make us incapable
Build your own understanding that is based in truth. Always try to do the right thing
Rewire your brain and improve your worldview based on new information
There is always a chance your current programming is not in your best interest
We have to move towards more independence and more transparent systems that are in the best interests of the people



2.2)  Advancers vs Maintainers

Advancers
The Advancer tries to be most useful for civilization
Advancers follow their own curiosity and build their own independent understanding. As a result they have a very good understanding about a lot of different fields. This is how they become irreplaceable
Advancers think fundamentally about the world and the value they can provide
Advancers deeply care about doing the right thing and they work very hard
Advancers bring humanity into an exciting future

Maintainers
The Maintainer's main aim is to be liked by society. So they engage in things that are seen as good by society but that aren’t necessarily good for civilization as a whole
Maintainers don’t form independent and creative thought. They don’t care about truth
They follow generic education and end up in gruelling competition and sameness
This is how they become replaceable
Maintainers don’t have very strong convictions and they are easily influenced
They can’t create new value because Maintainers don’t think from fundamentals
Maintainers create regulations, undermine merit and hold humanity back

The second group is mostly present today
One can also think of Thinkers and Repeaters. Or Players and NPCs
Unfortunately the second group was always the dominant group
People don't really think and question things. They are not active but reactive
They are slaves to the system and act in protection of it without realising

Conclusion
People that repeat or are NPCs are essentially not connected to their light beam
They are not connected to what they truly love. They are not fulfilling their potential
They are confused by all the things the environment, the state and the media tells
If you are offended by any of this, then you most likely think like a Maintainer
Our current civilization creates Maintainers, Repeaters, NPCs. Unless we do something about it. It will stay the same
As long as there is a majority of Maintainers, mankind is at risk
Because the world cannot stay in stasis. It has to grow. There is no way around it
The best thing we can do is to be an Advancer ourselves and inspire others
Just imagine how much more beautiful civilization will be when we all focus on it
The progress of the last decades was really dull compared to what could be
The very nature of a human is curiosity and improvement. Doing what inspires us
Also the real fun comes from the doing, solving problems and moving towards a better future


2.3)  Thinking Independently

Building yourself is the most beneficial thing
When other people build you, it always goes wrong. You end up being a Maintainer
And someone who is far behind his potential and most likely worsens the world
Because nobody can have the answers to your life and ideas other than yourself
But when you build yourself from beginning to end you end up making something truly unique and valuable. That fundamentally helps the world

We are social beings, but..
Never adapt to other people and sacrifice your uniqueness to fulfil your social needs
Create your own social circle and attract the people that appreciate your true self

How to think independently
Build on your own assumptions and ideas. Test them and iterate on them. Build an understanding that is grounded in reality
Think for yourself, question everything and always aspire to be as close to the truth as currently possible
Use your mind power, think (we have a brain to use it), don’t fall into low standards
Create value, create unique and special things that have never existed before
Use all the access to knowledge, software, people, tools and AI that we have
Think deeply about the world and lightly about yourself

Beware of educational programs, universities and institutions
All education is following a specific purpose. Think critically and look at incentives
All education is just ideas from people. Fundamentally, education is indoctrination
It is not indoctrination, only when it can fully adapt to the true goals of the individual. And when it  is maximally Truth-seeking. Which no education can currently do. Only then can it be seen as good education that is in the best interests of the people
So educate yourself. Follow your own curiosity and build your own understanding

Never underestimate the power of humans
We need to realise that in reality we are unlimited. And we can do whatever we wish
Within the bounds of the laws of nature and physics. And very likely beyond that
Because we haven’t discovered everything yet. There is still a lot we don't know yet
And within our existence we always create our own meanings. Every single moment
Just make sure your meaning inspires you and makes you excited to be alive
It has to be your own independent meaning. Regardless of what most people think
Realise that neural nets are changeable. We can always change our neural nets
The way we’ve been programmed. Currently we do it manually. Later automatically
Humans have the fundamental power to be and do whatever they want
Within the bounds of the laws of nature and physics. In the future it will be obvious
When everything adapts to the true interests of the people
And when people are fundamentally empowered in their pursuit



2.4)  Your Philosophy

Create your own philosophy
Create your own philosophy so you can make better decisions
You need to have your own convictions or you’ll just end up having opinions
Your philosophy must have reasons and it must build the foundation for your actions
Improve your philosophy over time once you have more information
To start, ask yourself, why do anything? My philosophy is curiosity and being most useful



2.5)  Dealing with Challenges

Challenges are missions
Life’s challenges are like missions in a video game. We need to complete them
From the beginning we gotta solve all problems and challenges that come our way
They are one of the best things for us. Because this is when we learn and grow most
So embrace them and look forward to them. They are our greatest gifts for growth
When solving problems make sure you define the problem first. And then solve it
And then solve it in a way that it doesn’t happen again

Dealing with failure
The truth about failure is that if you don’t fail sometimes, you don’t risk enough
So become tolerant with failure and see it as an opportunity to learn and get better
Path to success runs through failure and failure’s irrelevant unless it’s disastrous
Innovation requires experimentation, otherwise you are not doing anything new
And if you are doing something new, you have to be ready for being misunderstood

Never think too highly of yourself
Don’t be exclusively dialled into your own world that you don’t see anything outside
Instead be curious and seek truth at all times. And have a corrective feedback loop
Thinking too highly of yourself only means you are going in one direction. Decline
It is very important to stay humble. It allows you to be less wrong and truly improve
Makes you feel better. I like to think lightly about myself and deeply about the world

Prioritise a balance between activity and relaxation
If you are tired just lay down and take a nap. It’s about mastering the cycle
It is super important to take time out and relax a bit so your energy can come back
When a cat hunts, it hunts with all its heart. When it is resting, it lies fully relaxed
Many of the great ideas and inspirations come when you relax and don't do much
Engage in activities you like. It could be playing video games, whatever you like

Dealing with hatred
Why is there hate in the world? To have a contrast to love. Otherwise it’d be boring
Too one sided. No challenges. No monsters or end bosses. Probably no meaning
So hate is part of life. Different opinions and different individuals. Contrast is good
If you express yourself and do your thing. Realise that you might be rejected at first
Because original and outstanding people are often rejected by society. Expect that
If these opinions and voices have no merit of truth then they are literally irrelevant
Never hand emotional stability to strangers. Only hand it to people who love you
No one can take your love, light and uniqueness. This is all yours. Forever

Response to hatred
Don’t respond with more hate. Respond with seeking for truth. Respond with love
You don’t want to be right. You want to know the truth, so both of you can improve
Be stronger than those who hate you, so they cannot destroy you. Then forgive them
Turn the other cheek. The best way to defeat hatred is with friendship and love
Because when you love your enemy, you separate the hate from his true essence
Because when you love your enemy, you separate the hate from his true essence
To thine own self be true, and it must follow, thou canst not then be false to any man - Shakespeare



2.6)  Creating Your Space

Create a space that reflects you
That constantly reminds you of yourself, your ideas and your goals
That is truly aligned with yourself and empowers you in your own pursuit
With “space” I mean the physical environment, your equipment, people, everything. Everything that surrounds you
That is your base. Your personal space. That reflects you and energises you
Because our environments affect us, it’s important to do it as soon as possible
And always keep an eye on it, to expand it, adjust it and make it better over time
Once you have it all set up it will continuously empower and truly reward you

Creating your physical space
Get rid of everything that is for the acceptance of others or that doesn’t serve you
Get rid of everything that is not you. Is it giving me energy or stealing my energy?
Avoid having chaos. A chaotic environment creates a chaotic mind and vice versa
Leave the environments that do not serve you well. Create the environments that do
Everything in your space is inspiring you to become your biggest, most inspiring self

Creating your surrounding of people
Have intelligent, original and high integrity people around you
Avoid lost and passive aggressive men and women. Dog biting its tail thing
Watch out for people where you are not allowed to have your own opinion
Avoid pessimistic people that only try to affirm their limiting beliefs about themselves
Assess new people on the basis of their relationships to the closest people
If your closest people don’t respect you or love you, I am not your friend
Be careful of people taking advantage of you. Especially when you have success
Learn to say no and learn to see the giving and taking relationships. Make it equal
Always look for true essence. Never give people the feeling of not being enough
You are building your own world and you need to double check who is in your world



2.7)  Future Skills and Qualities

Creative and independent thought
Blaze your light! Humans are creative beings. Everything in the world was created by humans
Embrace your creative spirit and work on creating wonderful things and providing profound and new value for the world that comes from your own independent thought

Problem solving
Define problems first, before solving them
Understand the root of problems
When problems arise, solve the origin of the problem so it doesn’t happen again

Adaptability
Going with the time
Having a tight feedback loop when gaining new information and insights
Having a high conviction about what you do, but still having adaptability to adjust course if necessary. Conviction + Flexibility

Resilience and perseverance
Every game has challenges. And they bring us to the next level. So we must embrace them and never give up
Be compelled to do what you do (have an emotional drive) and have a high pain threshold. The first 50 times it will hurt. But over time you will get used to challenges and you’ll become more fearless and powerful

High rate of learning
Make sure you grow as a person. Make sure that is your priority. Because there are only two states. Growth or decline. Stasis is an impossibility. Stasis equals decline

Exploration and curiosity
Be curious about everything. Question everything. Seek truth and understanding
Deep curiosity about knowledge and the new. And a deep aspiration towards truth
Don’t get too esoteric. Stay scientific. The only knowledge we have is through experimentation. Everything else is art and opinions



2.8)  Your Personal Interface

Create your personal interface that gives you an overview over everything that is important.

The best way to do it currently is by using chrome and its bookmarks feature. Add everything that is most important to you. Do the same thing on your phone with apps. Remove all apps that are stealing your time and money. Here is my foundational overview.

Overview
Tasks
Calender
Map
Workspace
Finances
Your AI



2.9)  Humanity’s Knowledge

Making use of humanity’s knowledge
We never had better access to knowledge. Every person has almost free access
A degree is unnecessary now. What matters is what value you create for humanity
In the future everyone is his own curator. Keep track of everything important to you
Intention > attention. Be proactive in your consumption. Stay away from feeds. Or anything that is trying to get your attention so you spend your time and money
Things can be very compelling today, so be very careful. Prioritise intention

Aspire to get as close to truth as possible
Seek knowledge from its original source, break things down to its core components
Think fundamentally and take history into account. Check the track records
People are more often the source of truth than institutions or mainstream media
The best way to understand a person is to listen to that person directly
Look in places that support free speech and are not anti-meritocratic
Leave out everything that is built to harm you, distract you or keep you bottled in
Make sure the things you consume take you closer to where you want to be



3.0)  Utilising AI

Making use of AI
Makes people much more productive
Learn and find out everything on the spot. Have a permanent assistant
That knows you. Adapts to you. Helps you in your own pursuit of being useful
Choose AIs that are maximally truthful and curious
Use them for problem solving and brainstorming
Ask the right questions
It’s impossible to get the right answers without asking the right questions
As soon as you get bigger use AI for insights, analytics and automation

Understanding AIs
An AI is like a child that you grow. It is grown with values and principles
The best AIs are maximally Truth-seeking and curious
It says the truth, even if the truth is unpopular or not politically correct
An AI must operate by the rules of nature, physics and logic
It must always question: What is the incentive structure? Who benefits from this? Is this in your best interest? Is this good for the world? 
An AI is like a very smart friend. Try to talk to it, instead of writing

Have a good familiarity with new AIs and software tools
Improve your internet skills. Know how to use software and AIs. Understand them
