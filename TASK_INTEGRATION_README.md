# AI Task Management Integration

## Overview

The AI now has full capability to create, edit, and delete tasks directly from the chat interface. When users interact with the AI about task management, the AI can perform actions and render the results visually in the chat.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Task Management Tools

The AI has access to four main task management functions:

- **Create Task** (`createTask`): Creates new tasks with title, description, due date, and status
- **Update Task** (`updateTask`): Updates existing tasks (title, description, due date, status, completion)
- **Delete Task** (`deleteTask`): Permanently deletes tasks
- **Complete Task** (`completeTask`): Marks tasks as completed

### 2. Visual Task Action Display

Task actions are rendered in the chat with:

- Action icons (Plus for create, Edit for update, Trash for delete, Check for complete)
- Task details (title, description, due date, status)
- Status badges with appropriate colors
- Success/error states

### 3. Smart Task Detection

The AI automatically detects when users want to perform task actions through natural language:

- "Add a task to..."
- "Create a reminder for..."
- "Mark [task] as done"
- "Delete the task about..."
- "Update my task..."

## Usage Examples

### Creating Tasks

```
User: "Add a task to call the dentist tomorrow"
AI: Creates task with title "Call the dentist", due date tomorrow, and renders the task card
```

### Updating Tasks

```
User: "Mark my grocery shopping task as urgent"
AI: Updates the task status to urgent and shows the changes
```

### Completing Tasks

```
User: "I finished writing the report"
AI: Finds and completes the relevant task, shows completion confirmation
```

### Deleting Tasks

```
User: "Remove the old meeting task"
AI: Deletes the task and shows deletion confirmation
```

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified/Created

1. **`app/intelligence/api/chat/route.ts`**

   - Added task management tools using AI SDK tool system
   - Added task tools to streamText configuration
   - Enhanced system prompt with task management instructions

2. **`components/custom/task-action-display.tsx`** (NEW)

   - React component for rendering task actions in chat
   - Displays task details, status badges, and action confirmations
   - Handles all four task action types with appropriate styling

3. **`components/custom/message.tsx`**
   - Updated to render TaskActionDisplay for task-related tool invocations
   - Added loading states for task actions
   - Supports task tools alongside existing weather tools

### Tool Definitions

Each tool follows the AI SDK tool pattern:

```typescript
tool({
  description: "Tool description for AI understanding",
  parameters: z.object({
    // Zod schema for parameters
  }),
  execute: async (params) => {
    // Implementation using existing task actions
  },
})
```

### Integration Points

- **Task Context**: AI has access to user's current tasks through existing task context system
- **Task Actions**: Leverages existing `executeTaskAction` function from `lib/task-actions.ts`
- **Authentication**: Uses session-based authentication for secure task operations
- **Cache Invalidation**: Automatically clears task context cache after operations

## Testing the Integration

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure the development server is running
2. User must be authenticated
3. Navigate to `/intelligence` page

### Test Scenarios

1. **Basic Task Creation**

   - Message: "Create a task to buy groceries"
   - Expected: Task creation card appears in chat

2. **Task with Due Date**

   - Message: "Add a reminder to submit report by Friday"
   - Expected: Task created with parsed due date

3. **Task Status Management**

   - Message: "Mark my grocery task as urgent"
   - Expected: Task updated with urgent status

4. **Task Completion**

   - Message: "I completed the grocery shopping"
   - Expected: Task marked as completed

5. **Task Deletion**
   - Message: "Delete the old project task"
   - Expected: Task deleted with confirmation

### Error Handling

- Invalid task IDs show error states
- Authentication failures are handled gracefully
- Database errors display user-friendly messages

## Future Enhancements

1. **Recurring Tasks**: Extend to support recurring task creation
2. **Task Search**: Add ability to search and filter tasks via AI
3. **Bulk Operations**: Support for multiple task operations at once
4. **Task Dependencies**: Create linked or dependent tasks
5. **Time Parsing**: Enhanced natural language date/time parsing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Tasks not appearing**: Check if user is authenticated and has proper permissions
2. **Tool not triggering**: Ensure natural language clearly indicates task intent
3. **Visual not rendering**: Verify TaskActionDisplay component is properly imported

### Debug Mode

Add logging to see tool invocations:

```typescript
console.log("Task tool invoked:", { toolName, parameters })
```

## Configuration

The task management system uses the existing database schema and does not require additional configuration. It integrates seamlessly with the current task system while adding AI-driven capabilities.
